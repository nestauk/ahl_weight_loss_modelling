# Analysis

Scripts in this folder can be run in no particular order.

* `analysis.R`: script that takes in the outputs generated from the `Modelling` scripts and produces summary statistics and charts (saved in `outputs`figures`)
* `check_time.R`: script that produces the distribution of intake reduction for different timeframe scenarios (1,3,5 and 10 years). The final decision has been to focus on 3 years.
